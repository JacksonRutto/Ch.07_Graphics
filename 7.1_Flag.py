FLAG PROJECT
---------------
Make your flag 260 pixels tall
Use the scaling image on the website to determine other dimensions
The hexadecimal colors for the official flag are red:#BF0A30 and blue:#002868
Title the window, "The Stars and Stripes"
I used a draw_text command and used 20 pt. asterisks for the stars.
We will have a competition to see who can make this flag in the least lines of code.
The record is 16! You will have to use some loops to achieve this.
